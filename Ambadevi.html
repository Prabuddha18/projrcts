 <h2>legend of Krishna and Rukmini</h2>
<p>Mythology intertwines seamlessly with historical accounts within the deeply respected precincts of the Ambadevi Temple. Legend goes that Rukmini, daughter of King Bhishmak from Vidarbha, falls in love with Lord Krishna upon hearing tales of his boundless courage. However, her hand in marriage is already promised to King Shishupal of Chedi by her brother Rukmiya. Rukmini writes a letter to Krishna and they plan an elopement together. Rukmini visits the temple of Goddess Ekvira in Amravati. This is where Lord Krishna elopes with her and goes on to heroically defeat Rukmiya. In the end, King Bhishmak agrees to the union and organises a wedding ceremony for Krishna and Rukmini.

Thus, the temple serves as a timeless monument to their sacred bond, revered by devotees seeking blessings and solace. The locals believe Rukmini to have been a daughter of Amravati.
